Suppose you're encoding geometric shapes in a Cartesian (2D) coordinate system, and you represent a rectangle with four numeric variables:

l : horizontal position of left edge;
r : horizontal position of right edge;
t : vertical position of top edge;
b : vertical position of bottom edge.

a) Write an expression for the rectangle's area.
area = 

b) Write an expression which is true if the rectangle is taller than it is wide, and false otherwise.

c) Write an expression for the circumference of the biggest circle which can fit inside the rectangle. (Hint: you'll need logic similar to that in b.)

d) Write an expression for the area of the smallest circle which completely encloses (i.e. circumscribes) the rectangle.

e) Imagine subdividing your rectangle into 3 equal rows and 3 equal columns, which would create 9 smaller rectangles, identical in shape but varying by position. Define four new variables describing the centermost small rectangle. (Hint: one of the many solutions is very similar to the solution of 2b above.)
