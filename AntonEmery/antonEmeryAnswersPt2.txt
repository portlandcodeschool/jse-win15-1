All of the following can be solved with ordinary expressions and global variables with primitive values. You don't need functions, loops, or other topics beyond our first two classes.

2) (Difficulty: easy)

Assume variables x, y, and z are numbers.

a) Write an expression for the mean (i.e. average) of x, y, and z.
 var avg = (x + y + z) / 3

b) Write a series of expressions to adjust each of x, y, and z halfway toward their mean. That is, reset the value of each variable to something based on its previous value.
3 = (avg + 3) / 2
y = (avg + y) / 2
z = (z + avg) / 2
