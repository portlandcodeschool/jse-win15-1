Suppose you represent a fraction (n/d) with 2 integer variables: n for the numerator and d for the denominator. If n is greater than d, the fraction is "improper", but it can be rewritten as a proper fraction. For example, "7/4" is improper, but it can be rewritten as "1 3/4", which is proper.

Write an expression for a string expressing the proper form of an improper fraction n/d. For example, when n==7 and d==4, your resulting string should be "1 3/4". You may assume both n and d are positive integers and n > d, but otherwise you should be able to handle any values of n and d. (Hint: you'll need the modulo operator _%, and you'll probably want to create a couple of extra variables._)
