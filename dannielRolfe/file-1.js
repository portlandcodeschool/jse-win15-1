"1" == 1 /*Output: Always True The operand "==" represents Equal To. Because, javascript will try to help and convert the string "1" to 1 the output will be true.*/

//b)
"1" === 1 /*Output: Always False The operand "===" represents Equal Value and Equal Type. Unlike, "1"==1, where there is a type conversion, this operand is checking for equality. This operand is more precise than the equal to operand and therefor the better choice when checking for a more precise equality.*/

//c) --- Incorrect 
x == 'x' /*Output:true when x equals a number or a string Javascript will convert 'x' to a number; however, if x equals an object or undefined then the output is false*/

//correct answer - false UNLESS x is literally string 'x'

//d)
x == (x+'')

number == (number + '') /*Output:True  When x equals a number the first x converts to a string. */

null == (null+'') /*Output:False Null is an object and javascript does not know how to add an object to a string. */

undefined == (undefined + '') /*Output:false Undefined is "Undefined" and javascript does not know hot interpret undefined + string.*/

"string" == ("string" + '') /*Output:true a string is equal to a string*/


//e) 
'' == ' ' /*Output:false because the two strings differ in space. */

//f)
x = true /*Output: true because x is being declared as true.*/

//g) 
var x; x == 'undefined' /*Output: false because the variable x is declared, and although a value has not been assigned x is like ''. Therefore x does not equal 'undefined'*/

//h)
'9'<'10' /*Output:false because javascript is converting the first digits to numbers, therefore 9<1 is false */


//i) 
typeof x + 1 === "number" /*Output: always false because the operand "===" checks for equal value and in this operation "number" which is a string can not be of equal value to x + 1*/

//j) 

typeof x % 2 === "number" /*Output: always false because the operand "===" checks for equal value and in this operation "number" which is a string can not be of equal value to x mod 2 in any givin situation*/

//k) 

typeof (x % 2) === "number" /*Output: always true because the order of operations is to first calculate the mod in parenthesis and then check for equality. Therefore, if x is equal to 1 (1%2) === "number", 1 === "number":true*/

//l) 

x++ == ++x /*Output: always false because x++ returns x, then increments it and ++x increments x, and then returns it. Therefor, if x equals on 1++ == ++1 would evaluate to 1++ == 3 which is false. */

//n) ---- incorrect 
"1"+x == 1+x /*Output: false because if x=1, "1"+x will evaluate to 11 and 1 + 1 will evaluate to 2. Therefore, x=1; "1"+1 == 1+x; 11 == 2; false*/

/*correct answer - true when x is any string:
 '1'+x == 1+x
    '1'+'****' == 1+x
    '1****' == 1+x
    '1****' == '1****' */

//o) 
"0"+1 == 1 /*Output: true because "0"+1 will evaluate to 1, and 1 == 1 is true*/

//p) 
(typeof (x+1))===(typeof x) /*Output: true with the exception of when x is equal to null, undefined, or boolean */

//q) 
(x*1 == x) || ((typeof x) != "number") /*Output: true because when x equals 1 this evaluates to (1*1 == 1) true || ((typeof 1) != "number") false. The|| denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true.*/ 

/* side note true unless x is Nan*/

//r) ------------- not correct! 
(x=(typeof (x+(typeof x))))==x /*Output: Always true*/
x=1;
(1=(typeof (1+(typeof 1))))==1
(1=(typeof (1+("number"))))==1
(1=("number"))==1

/* Correct answer 
 true.  For any x, this becomes:
    (x=(typeof (x+'*****')))==x
    (x=(typeof 'x*****'))==x
    (x='string') == x
